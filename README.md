Classifying river geomorphology to better constrain remote discharge estimation algorithms
<br><br>
Included in this git repository is results from the study 'Constraining Remote River Discharge Estimation Using Reach-Scale Geomorphology', under review at WRR.
<br><br>
Classification is performed in a jupyter notebook (in python).  Other R scripts included in repository are for plotting figures.
<br><br>
Outputs folder includes results.
