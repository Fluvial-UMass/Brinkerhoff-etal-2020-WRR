# 2019_GeoClass
Included in this git repository is results (and scripts to produce the figures) from the study 'Constraining Remote River Discharge Estimation Using Reach-Scale Geomorphology', under review at WRR. To reproduce our figures, save all results files to a common directory and run the scripts. Note that many external (yet freely availble) datasets are necessary to run these scripts. Please consult the manuscript for where to access these.

The derivation of our river classification frameworks was performed in a jupyter notebook (in python). The R package implementation of our algorithm, geoBAM, is availble at https://github.com/craigbrinkerhoff/geoBAMr
