# Constraining Remote River Discharge Estimation Using Reach-Scale Geomorphology
Included in this git repository is results (and scripts to produce the figures) from the study 'Constraining Remote River Discharge Estimation Using Reach-Scale Geomorphology'. Note that many external (yet freely availble) datasets are necessary to run these scripts. Please consult the manuscript for where to access these. The archived repo for the study is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4073609

The derivation of our river classification frameworks was performed in a jupyter notebook (in python). The R package implementation of our algorithm, geoBAM, is available at https://github.com/craigbrinkerhoff/geoBAMr

The river widths extracted from the Mackenzie River network are available at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6vt45el17itpleg/AABXw7S58IIrAmsfwWzWVZ4Qa?dl=0.
