Included in this git repository is results (and scripts to produce the figures) from the study 'Constraining Remote River Discharge Estimation Using Reach-Scale Geomorphology', accepetd at WRR. Note that many external (yet freely availble) datasets are necessary to run these scripts. Please consult the manuscript for where to access these.
<br><br>
The derivation of our river classification frameworks was performed in a jupyter notebook (in python). The R package implementation of our algorithm, geoBAM, is available at https://github.com/craigbrinkerhoff/geoBAMr
<br><br>
The river widths extracted from the Mackenzie River network are available at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6vt45el17itpleg/AABXw7S58IIrAmsfwWzWVZ4Qa?dl=0.
